## Description

Machine Learning is a technique that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. In this project, a machine learning model was implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment (Google Colab). The objective of this task was to demonstrate the complete workflow of a machine learning model, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

For this implementation, the Iris dataset was used. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning that contains measurements of flowers such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each data sample belongs to one of three flower species. This dataset is suitable for beginners because it is clean, well-structured, and widely used for classification problems.

The first step of the implementation involved importing the required Python libraries. Libraries such as pandas were used for data handling, matplotlib was used for visualization, and scikit-learn was used for machine learning tasks like data splitting, model training, and evaluation. The dataset was loaded and converted into a tabular format for better understanding and analysis.

Next, the data was divided into two parts: features (X) and target labels (y). The features represent the flower measurements, while the target label represents the flower species. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets using an 80:20 ratio. The training data was used to teach the model, while the testing data was used to evaluate how well the model performs on unseen data.

A Random Forest Classifier was selected as the machine learning model. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. The model was trained using the training dataset, where it learned patterns and relationships between the features and the target labels.

After training, the model was used to make predictions on the test dataset. These predictions were compared with the actual labels to measure the model’s performance. The primary evaluation metric used was accuracy, which indicates the percentage of correct predictions made by the model.

In addition to numerical evaluation, a graphical comparison was performed using a scatter plot. The actual values were plotted as blue points, and the predicted values were plotted as red crosses. The close overlap between the actual and predicted values indicates that the model performed well and successfully learned from the data.

In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrates the end-to-end implementation of a machine learning model in a Jupyter Notebook. The model was trained, tested, and evaluated effectively, achieving good accuracy. This task provides a clear understanding of how machine learning models work in practice and fulfills the deliverable requirement of showcasing model implementation and evaluation.
